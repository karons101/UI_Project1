H3 hospital needs to come up with a system to enable its clients and patients to get registered, enter their details, medical records and update their information.  

  This will enable the medical doctors and administration keep up and be on top of all necessary information about each  

client or patient with a safe online user interface and storage. Due to past experience where paper records get lost or worn out. 

  

For this interface the user must register to attain access and then acquire unique ID(Identification) to have a page, from the login page, with registration of either a user(client) or a patient.  

  

On the user's page holds a logout button on the nav bar (Top right) and the page holds four forms for patient medical record Risk Factor Information Form, Hepatitis B Pregnant Women Reporting form, Congenital Syphilis Form and Chlamydia & Gonorrhea case reporting Form.  

These various forms hold much information to be entered by the patient like, names, age, address, phone number, race,  

country of birth, laboratory information, clinical information, test results, name of doctor that attended to the patient. 

  

  Pages dependencies: From the login page the user can register and after registration the user gets a home page which holds four medical report forms and can be updated and can be submitted.
